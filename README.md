# Machine Learning Project #
**P.S. The goal of our project has been switched from detecting the area of the room to estimating each type of the room after we discussed with our client and tutors.**

## Machine Learning Project: Bouygues - SpaceXYZ ## 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to **estimate each type of the room** given its floor plan. More precisely, the objectives are:
* Create a model that reads a PDF floor plan,then convert it into an image floor plan with segmentation.
* Find each room contour in a given image floor plan.
*  Feature extraction: Implement a model calculates
the surface area of each room, the compactness of
each room, the density of (non-white) pixels in
each room, and the adjacent rooms number of
each room.
* Design different machine learning models to
detect the type of each room, such as living room,
kitchen, and bedroom and compare their accuracy
and analyze these results.
